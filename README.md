# EDA_CASE_STUDY
This project aims to predict the likelihood of loan default among applicants using historical data of loan applicants. The dataset provides various features about each applicant, such as loan amount, interest rate, grade, employment length, debt-to-income ratio (DTI), and loan status (charged-off, fully paid, current).

# Background
When a loan application is received, the company must balance two types of risks:

1. Loss of business: Rejecting a loan to a creditworthy applicant results in lost revenue.
2. Financial loss: Approving a loan to a high-risk applicant may lead to default and financial loss.

# Objective
This project focuses on the initial stages of data analysis, including data loading, cleaning, univariate analysis, bivariate analysis, and visualization. The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset and identify potential patterns and correlations that may indicate a high likelihood of loan default.

# Dataset
The dataset contains information about past loan applicants, including their demographic, financial, and credit history. The dataset is labeled with the outcome of each loan application, indicating whether the applicant defaulted or not.

# Analysis
This project performs the following analyses:

1. Data loading and cleaning: Handling missing values, data normalization, and feature scaling.
2. Univariate analysis: Exploring individual variables and their distributions.
3. Bivariate analysis: Examining relationships between pairs of variables.
4. Visualization: Using plots and charts to illustrate key findings and insights.

# Insights
The project aims to identify potential patterns and correlations that may indicate a high likelihood of loan default. These insights can be used to inform future modeling and decision-making processes, such as denying loans to high-risk applicants, reducing loan amounts, or charging higher interest rates.

# Technologies Used
1. Python
2. Pandas
3. NumPy
4. Matplotlib
5. Seaborn
   
# Next Steps
This project lays the foundation for future work, including feature engineering, model selection, and model evaluation. The insights gained from this analysis can be used to develop a predictive model that identifies high-risk applicants and informs loan approval decisions.
