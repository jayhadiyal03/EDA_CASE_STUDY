# EDA_CASE_STUDY
This project aims to predict the likelihood of loan default among applicants using historical data of loan applicants. The dataset provides various features about each applicant, such as loan amount, interest rate, grade, employment length, debt-to-income ratio (DTI), and loan status (charged-off, fully paid, current).
